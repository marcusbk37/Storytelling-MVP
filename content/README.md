# RAG content

Drop your Markdown files with excerpts from excellent storytellers here. The ingest script will chunk and index them into Pinecone for use in Claude’s analysis feedback.

Supported: `.md` files. You can organize by author, theme, or a single file—the pipeline will chunk and embed all of them.
