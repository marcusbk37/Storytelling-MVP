Alastair: So, like a lot of queer kids in the 1980s, I ended up on my own pretty young. There were some harsh parts to that, but there were some awesome parts. Like, that Wednesday, when me and my best friend, Candy, were in a dive bar in New York City, 10 local bands for a dollar. Thanks to our new fake IDs. I was a little bit worried about mine that said I was a 40-year-old white man named Norman Schwartz. [audience laughter] But this was the kind of bar where it was like, “Eh, we're all human.” [audience laughter]

When the fourth band came on, the singer was the second coolest person in the world next to David Bowie. The awesome part was the whole set. He kept looking right at me and Candy. Now, because of our height difference, it's hard to tell if he was staring at her breast or my face. [audience laughter] But when the set finished, he came to talk to us, it was my face he was liking. He ended up writing his name and number on my arm, and he said, “I wrote that in Sharpie, so you can't forget to call me.” And Candy was like, “That's the most romantic thing. I think you guys are soul mates.” [audience laughter]

So, the next week, I met him in a different dive bar. We started talking. This bar was having a drink special, 25 cents shots of peppermint schnapps. I didn't know. [audience laughter] I had been on the street enough to be experiencing a lot of things, but peppermint schnapps, not so much. But Danny, the singer, ordered a dollar's worth. So, I was like, “Okay, we're about the same wage.” Sure,” I ordered a dollar's worth. We kept talking, and then this thing happened where the peppermint schnapps hit my skeletal system, - [audience laughter] -and it turned my bones into pudding and I fell on the floor, like in this big person puddle. [audience laughter]

I remember, like Danny saying, “Are you okay?” Being in a cab, maybe crawling on stairs. And then, it was morning. I woke up still fully clothed in a big, fluffy bed that weirdly smelled like Estée Lauder perfume. I looked to see if Danny was there, but instead, it was a 70-year-old woman. She was like, “Oh, you're awake, sweetie. I'm Danny's grandma. He was so worried that you might choke on your own vomit in the night that he asked me to watch over you.” And I was like, “This is not punk rock. I got to get out of here.” [audience laughter]

So, I found my shoes. I'm like, “Okay, thanks.” That's going to bolt for the door. But when I open the door into the main room of the apartment, there's Danny drinking coffee. He goes, “Good morning, Norman.” My fake ID’s sitting around the table in front of him. I sit down, and he pours me a cup of coffee and he says, “You know, it's really not cool you lied about your age.” I nod. He said, “You know, you were passed out drunk and not every guy would be decent about that.”

He was being so nice that somehow it just embarrassed me more and pissed me off. I was like, “I'm not some stupid baby you have to protect and lecture. I know people aren't decent. I've been knowing people aren't decent since I was 12. You could have done whatever you want to, because it wouldn't matter, you'd just be one more jerk in the world and I'm nothing.” 

I didn't mean that like just to sound punk rock somewhere there's some truth in it. He saw it, and I saw his face and then I just burst into these big, ugly, so un-David Bowie, so uncool sobs. [audience laughter]

I was sitting there crying, trying to get my other shoe on, and I heard him say, “You know what you're not to young for? Do you want to learn to play guitar?” I was like, “What?” He said, “I know. Like, I always thought if I had a little brother, I could teach him to play guitar.” And so, over the next year, I go over to their apartment, hang out with him and his grandma, learn chords. [audience laughter]

While the rest of my life had a lot of chaos in it, that was this one beautiful place where there was this friend that really respected me and liked me just for me. He moved to LA, the next year and we kept in touch by letters. But during those days of no internets, no cell phones, it was easy to eventually lose touch. The last letter I got from him was when I was 24, I'd ran to him to say I'd gone to rehab. I had three months clean, and I really saw a future for myself.

He wrote back in the last paragraph of the letter, he said, “I hope you're proud of yourself. I hope you make sure that the people in your life value you. And I hope you still play guitar.” “Yeah, Danny, yes to all three of those.” Thank you.
