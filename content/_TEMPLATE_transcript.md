## Example: Article Format

The best stories follow a simple arc: want, obstacle, resolution. But what 
separates good stories from great ones is specificity.

Don't say "I was nervous." Say "My hands were shaking so badly I couldn't 
get the key in the lock."

Specific details do two things:
1. They make the story believable
2. They let the audience feel what you felt

SPEAKER: So I'm standing there in the hospital waiting room, and my phone 
buzzes. It's my boss. And I know—I just know—he's calling to fire me.

But here's the thing. In that moment, I didn't care. My dad was in surgery, 
and for the first time in my life, I realized that my job wasn't my identity.

I let it go to voicemail.

## Example: Story Example Format

**What works:** This story uses a single concrete moment (phone buzzing) to 
represent a larger transformation. The stakes are clear. The detail is specific.

**Could improve:** The setup could be shorter. We don't need to know it's a 
hospital until the moment matters.
